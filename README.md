This project provides a simple RESTful API for managing video data (name, view count, and like count). It serves as a basic example of building a backend API with Flask and demonstrates database interaction using SQLAlchemy.

Key Functionalities:

CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete video entries via API endpoints.
Data Validation: Ensures data integrity through request parameter validation.
Error Handling: Provides informative error responses for invalid requests or missing resources.
Data Serialization: Returns structured JSON responses for consistent API output.
Database Persistence: Uses SQLAlchemy and SQLite for data storage.
